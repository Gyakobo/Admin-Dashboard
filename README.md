# React Admin Dashboard

Author: [Andrew Gyakobo](https://github.com/Gyakobo)

This is a sample project where I try to build an Admin Dashboard with ReactJS and the AWS S3. 

I also plan to add a database.

## Installation and Setup

To start with the project, run the following commands:

```bash
$ npm i @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/x-data-grid @mui/icons-material react-router-dom@6 react-pro-sidebar formik yup @fullcalendar/core @fullcalendar/daygrid @fullcalendar/timegrid @fullcalendar/list @nivo/core @nivo/pie @nivo/line @nivo/bar @nivo/geo
```
